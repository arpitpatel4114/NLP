systems accompanying industrial revolution 19th century age steam engine 20th century key technology information gathering processing distribution among developments saw installation worldwide telephone networks invention radio television birth unprecedented growth computer industry launching communication satellites course internet result rapid technological progress areas rapidly converging 21st century differences collecting transporting storing processing information quickly disappearing organizations hundreds offices spread wide geographical area routinely expect able examine current status even remote outpost push button ability gather process distribute information grows demand ever sophisticated information processing grows even faster although computer industry still young compared industries e g automobiles air transportation computers made spectacular progress short time first two decades existence computer systems highly centralized usually within single large room infrequently room glass walls visitors could gawk great electronic wonder inside medium sized company university might 2 introduction one two computers large institutions dozen idea within forty years vastly powerful computers smaller postage stamps would mass produced billions pure science fiction merging computers communications profound influence way computer systems organized dominant concept computer center room large computer users bring work processing totally obsolete although data centers holding thousands internet servers becoming common old model single computer serving organization computational needs replaced one large number separate interconnected computers job systems called computer networks design organization networks subjects book throughout book use term computer network mean collection autonomous computers interconnected single technology two computers said interconnected able exchange information connection need via copper wire fiber optics microwaves infrared communication satellites also used networks come many sizes shapes forms see later usually connected together make larger networks internet well known example network networks considerable confusion literature computer network distributed system key distinction distributed system collection independent computers appears users single coherent system usually single model paradigm presents users often layer software top operating system called middleware responsible implementing model well known example distributed system world wide web runs top internet presents model everything looks like document web page computer network coherence model software absent users exposed actual machines without attempt system make machines look act coherent way machines different hardware different operating systems fully visible users user wants run program remote machine log onto machine run effect distributed system software system built top network software gives high degree cohesiveness transparency thus distinction network distributed system lies software especially operating system rather hardware nevertheless considerable overlap two subjects example distributed systems computer networks need move files around difference lies invokes movement system user read throughout book sec 1 1 uses computer networks although book primarily focuses networks many topics also important distributed systems information distributed systems see tanenbaum van steen 2007 1 1 uses computer networks start examine technical issues detail worth devoting time pointing people interested computer networks used nobody interested computer networks would built start traditional uses companies move home networking recent developments regarding mobile users finish social issues 1 1 1 business applications companies substantial number computers example company may computer worker use design products write brochures payroll initially computers may worked isolation others point management may decided connect able distribute information throughout company put slightly general form issue resource sharing goal make programs equipment especially data available anyone network without regard physical location resource user obvious widespread example group office workers share common printer none individuals really needs private printer high volume networked printer often cheaper faster easier maintain large collection individual printers however probably even important sharing physical resources printers tape backup systems sharing information companies small large vitally dependent computerized information companies customer records product information inventories financial statements tax information much online computers suddenly went bank could last five minutes modern manufacturing plant computer controlled assembly line would last even 5 seconds even small travel agency three person law firm highly dependent computer networks allowing employees access relevant information documents instantly smaller companies computers likely single office perhaps single building larger ones computers employees may scattered dozens offices plants many countries nevertheless sales person new york might sometimes need access product inventory 4 introduction database singapore networks called vpns virtual private networks may used join individual networks different sites one extended network words mere fact user happens 15 000 km away data prevent using data though local goal may summarized saying attempt end tyranny geography simplest terms one imagine company information system consisting one databases company information number employees need access remotely model data stored powerful computers called servers often centrally housed maintained system administrator contrast employees simpler machines called clients desks access remote data example include spreadsheets constructing sometimes refer human user client

single company qualcomm cdma succeeded 2g system 95 matured point became technical basis 3g make cdma work mobile phone setting requires basic cdma technique described previous section specifically described synchronous cdma chip sequences exactly orthogonal design works users synchronized start time chip sequences case base station transmitting mobiles base station transmit chip sequences starting time signals orthogonal able separated however difficult synchronize transmissions independent mobile phones without care transmissions would arrive base station different times guarantee orthogonality let mobiles send base station without synchronization want code sequences orthogonal possible offsets simply aligned start possible find sequences exactly orthogonal general case long pseudorandom sequences come close enough property high probability low cross correlation offsets means one sequence multiplied another sequence summed compute inner product result small would zero orthogonal intuitively random sequences always look different multiplying together produce random signal sum small result lets receiver filter unwanted transmissions received signal also auto correlation sec 2 7 mobile telephone system pseudorandom sequences also small high probability except zero offset means one sequence multiplied delayed copy summed result small except delay zero intuitively delayed random sequence looks like different random sequence back cross correlation case lets receiver lock onto beginning wanted transmission received signal use pseudorandom sequences lets base station receive cdma messages unsynchronized mobiles however implicit assumption discussion cdma power levels mobiles receiver small cross correlation powerful signal might overwhelm large auto correlation weak signal thus transmit power mobiles must controlled minimize interference competing signals interference limits capacity cdma systems power levels received base station depend far

receives base station words mobile station receiving weak signal base station use power one getting strong signal accuracy base station also gives mobile feedback increase decrease hold steady transmit power feedback frequent 1500 times per second good power control important minimize interference another improvement basic cdma scheme described earlier allow different users send data

mobile must use one 5 mhz channel let us describe advantages cdma given dealt problems getting work three main advantages first cdma improve capacity taking advantage small periods transmitters silent polite voice calls one party silent talks average line busy 40 time however pauses may small difficult predict tdm fdm systems possible reassign time slots frequency channels quickly enough benefit small silences however cdma simply transmitting one user lowers interference users likely fraction users transmitting busy cell given time thus cdma takes advantage expected silences allow larger number simultaneous calls 178 physical layer second cdma cell uses frequencies unlike gsm amps fdm needed separate transmissions different users eliminates complicated frequency planning tasks improves capacity also makes easy base station use multiple directional antennas sectored antennas instead omnidirectional antenna directional antennas concentrate signal intended direction reduce

routers also another kind technology starting widely used especially isps order move internet traffic across networks technology sec 5 6 network layer internet called mpls multiprotocol label switching perilously close circuit switching despite fact many people internet community intense dislike connection oriented networking idea seems keep coming back yogi berra put like deja vu however essential differences way internet handles route construction way connection oriented networks technique certainly traditional circuit switching mpls adds label front packet forwarding based label rather destination address making label index internal table makes finding correct output line matter table lookup using technique forwarding done quickly advantage original motivation behind mpls began proprietary technology known various names including tag switching eventually ietf began standardize idea described rfc 3031 many rfcs main benefits time come routing flexible forwarding suited quality service well fast first question ask label go since ip packets designed virtual circuits field available virtual circuit numbers within ip header reason new mpls header added front ip header router router line using ppp framing protocol frame format including ppp mpls ip tcp headers shown headers ppp bits mpls ip tcp user data 3 1 label qos ttl crc transmitting tcp segment using ip mpls ppp generic mpls header 4 bytes long four fields important label field holds index qos field indicates class service field relates stacking multiple labels discussed ttl field indicates many times packet may forwarded decremented router hits 0 packet discarded feature prevents infinite looping case routing instability mpls falls ip network layer protocol ppp link layer protocol really layer 3 protocol depends ip network 472 network layer layer addresses set label paths really layer 2 protocol either forwards packets across multiple hops single link reason mpls sometimes described layer 2 5 protocol illustration real protocols always fit neatly ideal layered protocol model brighter side mpls headers part network layer packet data link layer frame mpls large extent independent layers among things property means possible build mpls switches forward ip packets non ip packets depending shows feature multiprotocol name mpls came mpls also carry ip packets non ip networks mpls enhanced packet arrives lsr label switched router label used index table determine outgoing line use also new label use label swapping used virtual circuit networks labels local significance two different routers feed unrelated packets label another router transmission outgoing line distinguishable end labels remapped every hop saw mechanism action mpls uses technique aside people distinguish forwarding switching forwarding process finding best match destination address table decide send packets example longest matching prefix algorithm used ip forwarding contrast switching uses label taken packet index forwarding table simpler faster definitions far universal however since hosts routers understand mpls also ask labels attached packets happens ip packet reaches edge mpls network ler label edge router inspects destination ip address fields see mpls path packet follow puts right label front packet within mpls network label used forward packet edge mpls network label served purpose removed revealing ip packet next network process shown one difference traditional virtual circuits level aggregation certainly possible flow set labels mpls network however common routers group multiple flows end particular router lan use single label flows grouped together single label said belong fec forwarding equivalence class class covers packets going also service class differentiated services sense packets treated way forwarding purposes traditional virtual circuit routing possible group several distinct paths different endpoints onto virtual circuit identifier would way distinguish final destination mpls sec 5 6 ip network layer internet add label label switching label label remove label ip label ip next network label edge router label switch router forwarding ip packet mpls network packets still contain final destination address addition label end labeled route label header removed forwarding continue usual way using network layer destination address actually mpls goes even operate multiple levels adding one label front packet example suppose many packets already different labels want treat packets differently somewhere network follow common path destination instead setting many label switching paths one different labels set single path already labeled packets reach start path another label added front called stack labels outermost label guides packets along path removed end path labels revealed used forward packet bit allows router removing label know additional labels left set 1 bottom label 0 labels final question ask label forwarding tables set packets follow one area major difference mpls conventional virtual circuit designs traditional virtual circuit networks user wants establish connection setup packet launched network create path make forwarding table entries mpls involve users setup phase requiring users anything send datagram would break much existing internet software instead forwarding information set protocols combination routing protocols connection setup protocols control protocols cleanly separated label forwarding allows multiple different control protocols used one variants works like router booted checks see routes final destination e g prefixes belong interfaces creates one fecs allocates label one passes labels neighbors turn enter labels forwarding tables send new labels neighbors routers acquired path resources also reserved 474 network layer path constructed guarantee appropriate quality service variants set different paths traffic engineering paths take unused capacity account create paths demand support service offerings quality service although basic ideas behind mpls straightforward details complicated many variations use cases actively developed information see

earlier chapter repeat material however worth noting forms addressing exist particular x 400 addresses look radically different dns addresses x 400 iso standard message handling systems one time competitor smtp smtp handily though x 400 systems still used mostly outside u x 400 addresses composed attribute value pairs separated slashes example c us st massachusetts l cambridge pa 360 memorial dr cn ken smith address specifies country state locality personal address common name ken smith many attributes possible send email 630 application layer someone whose exact email address know

enter select person name get correct email address consequently usually necessary actually type strange strings final point touch sending mail mailing lists let users send message list people single command two choices mailing list maintained might maintained locally user agent case user agent send separate message intended recipient alternatively list may maintained remotely message transfer agent messages expanded message transfer system effect allowing multiple users send list example group bird watchers mailing list called birders installed transfer agent meadowlark arizona edu message

used rfc 5322 message header reply field sometimes used neither person composing message person sending message wants see reply example marketing manager may write email message telling customers new product message sent assistant reply field lists head sales department answer questions take orders field also useful sender two email accounts wants reply go one message id automatically generated number used link messages together e g used reply field prevent duplicate delivery rfc 5322 document explicitly says users allowed invent optional headers private use convention since rfc 822 headers

messages line exceeded 1000 characters ascii characters use 7 bits 8 bit byte binary data executable programs images use 8 bits byte 634 application layer extended character sets guarantee data would transferred safely hence method carrying binary data made look like regular ascii mail message needed extensions smtp since development mime allow 8 bit binary data transferred though even today binary data may always go mail system correctly unencoded mime provides five transfer encoding schemes plus escape new schemes case simplest scheme ascii text messages ascii characters use 7 bits carried directly email protocol provided line exceeds 1000 characters next simplest scheme thing using 8 bit characters values 0 including 255 allowed messages using 8 bit encoding must still adhere standard maximum line length messages use true binary encoding arbitrary binary files use 8 bits also adhere 1000 character line limit executable programs fall category nowadays mail servers negotiate send data binary 8 bit encoding falling back ascii ends support extension ascii encoding binary data called base64 encoding scheme groups 24 bits broken four 6 bit units unit sent legal ascii character coding 0 b 1 followed 26 lowercase letters 10 digits finally 62 63 respectively sequences indicate last group contained 8 16 bits respectively carriage returns line feeds ignored inserted encoded character stream keep lines short enough arbitrary binary text sent safely using scheme albeit inefficiently encoding popular binary capable mail servers widely deployed still commonly seen messages almost entirely ascii non ascii characters base64 encoding somewhat inefficient instead encoding known quoted printable encoding used 7 bit ascii characters 127 encoded equals sign followed character value two hexadecimal digits control characters punctuation marks math symbols well trailing spaces also encoded finally valid reasons use one schemes possible specify user defined encoding

allows one message fully encapsulated inside another scheme useful forwarding email example complete rfc 822 message encapsulated inside outer message rfc822 subtype used similarly common html documents encapsulated partial subtype makes possible break encapsulated message pieces send separately example encapsulated message long parameters make possible reassemble parts destination correct order finally multipart type allows message contain one part beginning end part clearly delimited mixed subtype allows part different type additional structure imposed many email programs allow user provide one attachments text message attachments sent using multipart type contrast mixed alternative subtype allows message included multiple times expressed two different media example message could

hypertext markup language introduced web allows users produce web pages include text graphics video pointers web pages html markup language language describing documents formatted term markup comes old days copyeditors actually marked documents tell printer days human fonts use markup languages thus contain explicit commands formatting example html b means start boldface mode b means leave boldface mode latex tex examples markup languages well known academic authors key advantage markup language one explicit markup separates content presented writing browser straightforward browser simply understand markup commands apply content embedding markup commands within html file standardizing makes possible web browser read reformat web page crucial page may produced 1600 1200 window 24 bit color high end computer may displayed 640 320 window mobile phone certainly possible write documents like plain text editor many people also possible use word processors special html editors work correspondingly give user less direct control details final result simple web page written html presentation browser given web page consists head body enclosed html html tags formatting commands although browsers complain tags missing seen head bracketed head head tags body bracketed body body tags strings inside tags called directives html tags format use something mark beginning something something mark end tags either lowercase uppercase thus head head mean thing lower case best compatibility actual layout html document irrelevant html parsers ignore extra spaces carriage returns since reformat text make fit current display area consequently white space added make html documents 664 application layer readable something badly need another consequence blank lines used separate paragraphs simply ignored explicit tag required tags named parameters called attributes example img tag used including image inline text two attributes src alt first attribute gives url image html standard specify image formats permitted practice browsers support gif jpeg files browsers free support formats extension two edged sword user accustomed browser supports say tiff files may include

photos h1 instructs browser emphasize heading say anything typeface point size color left browser knows properties display e g many pixels however many web page designers wanted absolute control pages appeared new tags added html control appearance font face helvetica size 24 color red deborah photos font sec 7 3 world wide web also ways added control positioning screen accurately trouble approach tedious produces bloated html portable although page may render perfectly browser developed may complete mess another browser another release browser different screen resolution better alternative use style sheets style sheets text editors allow authors associate text logical style instead physical style example initial paragraph instead italic text appearance style defined separately way author decides change initial paragraphs 14 point italics blue 18 point boldface shocking pink requires changing one definition convert entire document css cascading style sheets introduced style sheets web html 4 0 though widespread use browser support take 2000 css defines simple language describing rules control appearance tagged content let us look example suppose awi wants snazzy web pages navy text arial font white background level headings extra 100 50 larger text level respectively css definition gives rules body background color linen color navy font family arial h1 font size 200 h2 font size 150 css example seen style definitions compact line selects element applies gives values properties properties element apply defaults html elements contains thus style body sets style paragraphs text body also convenient shorthands color names e g red style parameters defined filled defaults browser behavior makes style sheet definitions optional reasonable presentation occur without style sheets placed html file e g using style tag common place separate file reference example head tag awi page modified refer style sheet file awistyle css shown example also shows mime type css files text css head title amalgamated widget inc title link rel stylesheet type text css href awistyle css head including css style sheet 672 application layer strategy two advantages first lets one set styles applied many pages web site organization lends consistent appearance pages even developed different authors different times allows look entire site changed editing one css file html method compared include file c program changing one macro definition changes program files include header second advantage html files downloaded kept small browser download one copy css file pages reference need download new copy definitions along web page 7 3 3 dynamic web pages web applications static page model used far treats pages multimedia documents conveniently linked together fitting model early days web vast amounts information put online nowadays much excitement around web using applications services examples include buying products e commerce sites searching library catalogs exploring maps reading sending email collaborating documents new uses like traditional application software e g mail readers word processors twist applications run inside browser user data stored servers internet data centers use web protocols access information via internet browser display user interface advantage approach users need install separate application programs user data accessed different computers backed service operator proving successful rivaling traditional application software course fact applications offered free large providers helps model prevalent form cloud computing computing moves individual desktop computers shared clusters servers internet act applications web pages longer static dynamic content needed example page library catalog reflect books currently available books checked thus available similarly useful stock market page would allow user interact page see stock prices different periods time compute profits losses examples suggest dynamic content generated programs running server browser places section examine two cases turn general situation shown example consider map service lets user enter street address presents corresponding map location given

program may need data server case program send request server step 5 retrieve information database step 6 return response step 7 program continue updating page step 4 requests responses happen background user may even aware page url title typically change including client side programs page present responsive interface server side programs alone server side dynamic web page generation let us look case server side content generation detail simple situation server side processing necessary use forms consider user filling awi order form b clicking submit order button user clicks request sent server url specified form post http widget com cgi bin order cgi case along contents form filled user data must given program script process thus url identifies program run data provided program input case processing would involve entering order awi internal system updating customer records charging credit card page returned request depend happens processing fixed like static page order succeeds page returned might give expected shipping date unsuccessful returned page might say widgets requested stock credit card valid reason 674 application layer exactly server runs program instead retrieving file depends design web server specified web protocols interface proprietary browser need know details far browser concerned simply making request fetching page nonetheless standard apis developed web servers invoke programs existence interfaces makes easier developers extend different servers web applications briefly look two apis give sense entail first api method handling dynamic page requests available since beginning web called cgi common gateway interface defined rfc 3875 cgi provides interface allow web servers talk back end programs scripts accept input e g forms generate html pages response programs may written whatever language convenient developer usually scripting language ease development pick python ruby perl favorite language convention programs invoked via cgi live directory called cgi bin visible url server maps request directory program name executes program separate process provides data sent request input program output program gives web page returned browser example program order cgi invoked input form encoded shown parse parameters process order useful convention program return html order form form input provided way program sure know representation form second api look quite different approach embed little scripts inside html pages executed server generate page popular language writing scripts php php hypertext preprocessor use server understand php browser understand css interpret web pages style sheets usually servers identify web pages containing php file extension php rather html htm php simpler use cgi example works forms see example top part figure contains normal html page simple form time form tag specifies action php invoked handle parameters user submits form page displays two text boxes one request name one

cached copy page page would fetched sec 7 3 world wide web determination made solely url example url may give page displays latest news item contents page updated frequently even though url stays alternatively contents page may list gods greek roman mythology page change somewhat less rapidly http uses two strategies tackle problem shown forms processing request step 1 response step 5 first strategy page validation step 2 cache consulted copy page requested url known fresh e still valid need fetch anew server instead cached page returned directly expires header returned cached page originally fetched current date time used make determination 1 request 2 check expiry 3 conditional get 4a modified program cache 5 response 4b response web browser web server http caching however pages come convenient expires header tells page must fetched making predictions hard especially future case browser may use heuristics example page modified past year told last modified header fairly safe bet change next hour guarantee however may bad bet example stock market might closed day page change hours change rapidly next trading session starts thus cacheability page may vary wildly time reason heuristics used care though often work well practice finding pages expired beneficial use caching means server need contacted unfortunately always work servers must use expires header conservatively since may unsure page updated thus cached copies may still fresh client know second strategy used case ask server cached copy still valid request conditional get shown step 3 server knows cached copy still valid send short reply say step 4a otherwise must send full response step 4b 692 application layer header fields used let server check whether cached copy still valid client time cached page last updated lastmodified header send time server using modified since header ask page changed meantime alternatively server may return etag header page header gives tag short name content page like checksum better cryptographic hash describe chap 8 client validate cached copies sending server none match header listing tags cached copies tags match content server would respond corresponding cached copy may used method used convenient useful determine freshness example server may return different content url depending languages mime types preferred case modification date alone help server determine cached page fresh finally note caching strategies overridden directives carried cache control header directives used restrict caching e g cache appropriate example dynamic page different next time fetched pages require authorization also cached much caching space make two important points first caching performed places besides browser general case http requests routed series caches use cache external browser called proxy caching added level caching help reduce requests chain common organizations isps companies run proxy caches gain benefits caching pages across

3 described parity providing error detection providing error correction answer case known packet lost lost data called erasure chap 3 considered frame received bits error know bit errored case harder deal erasures thus erasures parity provide error correction without erasures parity provide error detection see another unexpected benefit parity soon get multicast scenarios second strategy called interleaving approach based mixing interleaving order media transmission unmixing sec 7 4 streaming audio video deinterleaving reception way packet burst packets lost loss spread time unmixing result single large gap media played example packet might contain 220 stereo samples containing pair 16 bit numbers normally good 5 msec music samples sent order lost packet would represent 5 msec gap music instead samples transmitted shown fig 753 even samples 10 msec interval sent one packet followed odd samples next one loss packet 3 represent 5 msec gap music loss every sample 10 msec loss handled easily media player interpolate using previous succeeding samples result lower temporal resolution 10 msec noticeable time gap media packet contains 220 even time samples packet contains 220 odd time samples legend lost packet even time sample odd time sample b 15 time msec packets carry alternate samples loss packet reduces temporal resolution rather creating gap time interleaving scheme works uncompressed sampling however interleaving short periods time individual samples also applied compression long way find sample boundaries compressed stream rfc 3119 gives scheme works compressed audio interleaving attractive technique used needs additional bandwidth unlike fec however interleaving adds latency like fec need wait group packets arrive de interleaved media player third job decompressing content although task computationally intensive fairly straightforward thorny issue decode media network protocol correct transmission errors many compression schemes later data decompressed earlier data decompressed later data encoded relative earlier data udp based transport packet loss thus encoding 718 application layer process must designed permit decoding despite packet

networks work well need understanding traffic must carry shift content example servers migrated company offices internet data centers provide large numbers machines excellent network connectivity run even small server nowadays easier cheaper rent virtual server hosted internet data center operate real machine home office broadband connectivity internet fortunately two facts internet traffic essential know first fact changes quickly details overall makeup 1994 traffic traditional ftp file transfer moving programs data sets computers email web arrived grew exponentially web traffic left ftp email traffic dust long dot com bubble 2000 starting around 2000 p2p file sharing music movies took 2003 internet traffic p2p traffic leaving web dust sometime late 2000s video streamed using content distribution methods sites like youtube began exceed p2p traffic 2014 cisco predicts 90 internet traffic video one form another cisco 2010 always traffic volume matters instance voice ip traffic boomed even skype started 2003 always minor blip chart bandwidth requirements audio two orders magnitude lower video however voice ip traffic stresses network ways sensitive latency another example online social networks grown furiously since facebook started 2004 2010 first time facebook reached users web per day google even putting traffic aside awful lot traffic online social networks important changing way people interact via internet point making seismic shifts internet traffic happen quickly regularity come next please check back 6th edition book let know second essential fact internet traffic highly skewed many properties familiar clustered around average instance adults close average height tall people short people tall short people kinds properties possible design range large nonetheless captures majority population internet traffic like long time known small number web sites massive traffic vast number web site much smaller traffic feature become part language networking early papers talked traffic terms packet trains idea sec 7 5 content delivery express trains large number packets would suddenly travel link jain routhier 1986 formalized notion selfsimilarity purposes thought network traffic exhibits many short many long gaps even viewed different time scales leland et al 1994 later work spoke long traffic flows elephants short traffic flows

single server machine talking multiple client machines build large web sites perform well speed processing either server side client side server side powerful web servers built server farm cluster computers acts single server client side better performance sec 7 5 content delivery achieved better caching techniques particular proxy caches provide large shared cache group clients describe techniques turn however note neither technique sufficient build largest web sites popular sites require content distribution methods describe following sections combine computers many different locations server farms matter much bandwidth one machine serve many web requests load great solution case use one computer make web server leads server farm model internet access balances load across servers backend database front end server farm servers clients server farm difficulty seemingly simple model set computers make server farm must look like single logical web site clients set different web sites run parallel several possible solutions make set servers appear one web site solutions assume servers handle request client server must copy web site servers shown connected common back end database dashed line purpose one solution use dns spread requests across servers server farm dns request made web url dns server returns rotating list ip addresses servers client tries one ip address typically first list effect different clients contact different servers access web site intended dns method heart cdns revisit later section solutions based front end sprays incoming requests pool servers server farm happens even client 740 application layer contacts server farm using single destination ip address front end usually link layer switch ip router device handles frames packets solutions based servers peeking network transport application layer headers using nonstandard ways web request response carried tcp connection work correctly front end must distribute packets request server simple design front end broadcast incoming requests servers server answers fraction requests prior agreement example 16 servers might look source ip address reply request last 4 bits source ip address match configured selectors packets discarded wasteful incoming bandwidth often responses much longer request nearly inefficient sounds general design front end may inspect ip tcp http headers packets arbitrarily map server mapping called load balancing policy goal balance workload across servers policy may simple complex simple policy might use servers one turn round robin approach front end must remember mapping request subsequent packets part request sent server also make site reliable single server front end notice servers failed stop sending requests much like nat general design perilous least fragile created device violates basic principle layered protocols layer must use header control purposes may inspect use information payload purpose people design systems anyway break future due changes higher layers tend surprised front end case switch router may take action based transport layer information higher box called middlebox interposes middle network path business according protocol stack case front end best considered internal part server farm terminates layers application layer hence use header information layers nonetheless nat design useful practice reason looking tcp headers possible better job load balancing ip information alone example one ip address may represent entire company make many requests looking tcp higherlayer information requests mapped different servers reason looking http headers somewhat different many web interactions access update databases customer looks recent purchase server fields request query back end database useful direct subsequent requests user sec 7 5 content delivery server server already cached information user simplest way cause happen use web cookies information distinguish user inspect http headers find cookies final note although described design web sites server farm built kinds servers well example servers streaming media udp change required front end able load balance requests different protocol header fields web requests web proxies web requests responses sent using http sec 7 3 described browsers cache responses reuse answer future requests various header fields rules used browser determine cached copy web page still fresh repeat material caching improves performance shortening response time reducing network load browser determine cached page fresh page fetched cache immediately network traffic however even browser must ask server confirmation page still fresh response time shortened network load reduced especially large pages since small message needs sent however best browser cache web pages user previously visited discussion popularity may recall well popular pages many people visit repeatedly many many unpopular pages practice limits effectiveness browser caching large number pages visited given user pages always fetched server one strategy make caches effective share cache among multiple users way page already fetched one user returned another user user makes request without browser caching users would need fetch page server course sharing done encrypted traffic pages require authentication uncacheable pages e g current stock prices returned programs dynamic pages created programs especially growing case caching effective nonetheless plenty web pages visible many users look matter user makes request e g images web proxy used share cache among users proxy agent acts behalf someone else user many kinds proxies instance arp proxy replies arp requests behalf user elsewhere reply web proxy fetches web requests behalf users normally provides caching web responses since shared across users substantially larger cache browser 742 application layer proxy used typical setup organization operate one web proxy users organization might company isp stand benefit speeding web requests users reducing bandwidth needs flat pricing independent usage common end users companies isps charged according bandwidth use setup shown use proxy browser configured make page requests proxy instead page real server proxy page returns page immediately fetches page server adds cache future use returns client requested browser cache organization internet proxy cache servers clients proxy cache web browsers web servers well sending web requests proxy instead real server clients perform caching using browser cache proxy consulted browser tried satisfy request cache proxy provides second level caching proxies may added provide additional levels caching proxy browser makes requests via upstream proxy upstream proxy caches downstream proxies browsers thus possible browsers company use company proxy uses isp proxy contacts web servers directly however single level proxy caching shown often sufficient gain potential benefits practice problem long tail popularity studies web traffic shown shared caching especially beneficial number users reaches size small company say 100 people number people grows larger benefits sharing cache become marginal unpopular requests cached due lack storage space wolman et al 1999 web proxies provide additional benefits often factor decision deploy one benefit filter content administrator may configure sec 7 5 content delivery proxy blacklist sites otherwise filter requests makes example many administrators frown employees watching youtube videos worse yet pornography company time set filters accordingly another benefit proxies privacy anonymity proxy shields identity user server 7 5 3 content delivery networks server farms web proxies help build large sites improve web performance sufficient truly popular web sites must serve content global scale sites different approach needed cdns content delivery networks turn idea traditional web caching head instead clients look copy requested page nearby cache provider places copy page set nodes different locations directs client use nearby node server example path data follows distributed cdn shown tree origin server cdn distributes copy content nodes cdn sydney boston amsterdam example shown dashed lines clients fetch pages nearest node cdn shown solid lines way clients sydney fetch page copy stored sydney fetch page origin server may europe cdn origin server distribution cdn nodes cdn node sydney page fetch boston amsterdam worldwide clients cdn distribution tree using tree structure three virtues first content distribution scaled many clients needed using nodes cdn levels tree distribution among cdn nodes becomes bottleneck matter many clients tree structure efficient origin server overloaded talks many clients via tree 744 application layer cdn nodes answer request page second client gets good performance fetching pages nearby server instead distant server round trip time setting connection shorter tcp slow start ramps quickly shorter round trip time shorter network path less likely pass regions congestion internet finally total load placed network also kept minimum cdn nodes well placed traffic given page pass part network important someone pays network bandwidth eventually idea using distribution tree straightforward less simple organize clients use tree example proxy servers would seem provide solution looking client configured use sydney boston amsterdam cdn node caching web proxy distribution would follow tree however strategy falls short practice three reasons first reason clients given part network probably belong different organizations probably using different web proxies recall caches usually shared across organizations limited benefit caching large number clients security reasons second multiple cdns client uses single proxy cache cdn client use proxy finally perhaps practical issue web proxies configured clients may may configured benefit content distribution cdn little cdn another simple way support distribution tree one level use mirroring approach origin server replicates content cdn nodes cdn nodes different network regions called mirrors web pages origin server contain explicit links different mirrors usually telling user location design lets user manually select nearby mirror use downloading content typical use mirroring place large software package mirrors located example east west coasts u asia europe mirrored sites generally completely static choice sites remains stable months years tried tested technique however depend user distribution mirrors really different web sites even linked together third approach overcomes difficulties previous two approaches uses dns called dns redirection suppose client wants fetch page url http www cdn com page html fetch page browser use dns resolve www cdn com ip address dns lookup proceeds usual manner using dns protocol browser learns ip address name server cdn com contacts name server ask resolve www cdn com comes really clever bit name server run cdn instead returning ip address request look ip address client making request return sec 7 5 content delivery different answers answer ip address cdn node nearest client client sydney asks cdn name server resolve www cdn com name server return ip address sydney cdn node client amsterdam makes request name server return ip address amsterdam cdn node instead strategy perfectly legal according semantics dns previously seen name servers may return changing lists ip addresses name resolution sydney client fetch page directly sydney cdn node pages server fetched directly sydney cdn node well dns caching overall sequence steps shown sydney cdn node cdn origin server amsterdam cdn node 1 distribute content 4 fetch page 2 query dns 3 contact sydney sydney clients cdn dns server contact amsterdam amsterdam clients directing clients nearby cdn nodes using dns complex question process means find nearest cdn node go define nearest really geography matters least two factors consider mapping client cdn node one factor network distance client short high capacity network path cdn node situation produce quick downloads cdns use map previously computed translate ip address client network location cdn node selected might one shortest distance crow flies might matters combination length network path capacity limits along second factor load already carried cdn node cdn nodes overloaded deliver slow responses like overloaded web server sought avoid first place thus may necessary balance load across cdn nodes mapping clients nodes slightly away lightly loaded techniques using dns content distribution pioneered akamai starting 1998 web groaning load early 746 application layer growth akamai first major cdn became industry leader probably even clever idea using dns connect clients nearby nodes incentive structure business companies pay akamai deliver content clients responsive web sites customers like use cdn nodes must

distances 60 km fiber equipment complex expensive still idea promise information quantum cryptography see mullins 2002 8 1 5 two fundamental cryptographic principles although study many different cryptographic systems pages ahead two principles underlying important understand pay attention violate peril sec 8 1 cryptography redundancy first principle encrypted messages must contain redundancy information needed understand message example may make clear needed consider mail order company couch potato tcp 60 000 products thinking efficient tcp programmers decide ordering messages consist 16byte customer name followed 3 byte data field 1 byte quantity 2 bytes product number last 3 bytes encrypted using long key known customer tcp first might seem secure sense passive intruders decrypt messages unfortunately also fatal flaw renders useless suppose recently fired employee wants punish tcp firing leaving takes customer list works night writing program generate fictitious orders using real customer names since list keys puts random numbers last 3 bytes sends hundreds orders tcp messages arrive tcp computer uses customers name locate key decrypt message unfortunately tcp almost every 3byte message valid computer begins printing shipping instructions might seem odd customer order 837 sets children swings 540 sandboxes computer knows customer might planning open chain franchised playgrounds way active intruder exemployee cause massive amount trouble even though understand messages computer generating problem solved addition redundancy messages example order messages extended 12 bytes first 9 must zeros attack longer works ex employee longer generate large stream valid messages moral story messages must contain considerable redundancy active intruders send random junk interpreted valid message however adding redundancy makes easier cryptanalysts break messages suppose mail order business highly competitive couch potato main competitor sofa tuber would dearly love know many sandboxes tcp selling taps tcp phone line original scheme 3 byte messages cryptanalysis nearly impossible guessing key cryptanalyst way telling whether right almost every message technically legal new 12 byte scheme easy cryptanalyst tell valid message invalid one thus cryptographic principle 1 messages must contain redundancy words upon decrypting message recipient must able tell whether valid simply inspecting message perhaps performing 778 network security simple computation redundancy needed prevent active intruders sending garbage tricking receiver decrypting garbage acting plaintext however redundancy makes much easier passive intruders break system tension furthermore redundancy never form n 0s start end message since running messages cryptographic algorithms gives predictable results making cryptanalysts job easier crc polynomial much better run 0s since receiver easily verify generates work cryptanalyst even better use cryptographic hash concept explore later moment think better crc getting back quantum cryptography moment also see redundancy plays role due trudy interception photons bits bob one time pad wrong bob needs redundancy incoming messages determine errors present one crude form redundancy repeating message two times two copies identical bob knows either fiber noisy someone tampering transmission course sending everything twice overkill hamming reed solomon code efficient way error detection correction clear redundancy needed distinguish valid message invalid message especially face active intruder freshness second cryptographic principle measures must taken ensure message received verified fresh sent recently measure needed prevent active intruders playing back old messages measures taken ex employee could tap tcp phone line keep repeating previously sent valid messages thus cryptographic principle 2 method needed foil replay attacks one measure including every message timestamp valid say 10 seconds receiver keep messages around 10 seconds compare newly arrived messages previous ones filter duplicates messages older 10 seconds thrown since replays sent 10 seconds later rejected old measures timestamps discussed later 8 2 symmetric key algorithms modern cryptography uses basic ideas traditional cryptography transposition substitution emphasis different traditionally

someone else promised scheme require ca online verification thus eliminating potential bottleneck standard function certificate bind public key principal certificate also used bind public key attribute example certificate could say public key belongs someone 18 could used prove owner private key minor thus allowed access material suitable children without disclosing owner identity typically person holding certificate would send web site principal process cared age site principal process would generate random number encrypt public key certificate owner able decrypt send back sec

going back root like sometimes called chain trust certification path technique widely used practice course still problem going run root solution single root many roots ras cas fact modern browsers

trusting browser vendor make wise choices simply approve trust anchors willing pay inclusion fee browsers allow users inspect root keys usually form certificates signed root delete seem shady directories another issue pki certificates chains back known trust anchor stored one possibility user store certificates safe e way users tamper signed certificates without detection also inconvenient one alternative proposed use dns certificate directory contacting bob alice probably look ip address using dns dns return bob entire certificate chain along ip address people think way go others would prefer dedicated directory servers whose job managing x 509 certificates directories could provide lookup services using properties x 500 names example theory directory service could answer query give list people named alice work sales departments anywhere u canada revocation real world full certificates passports drivers licenses sometimes certificates revoked example drivers licenses revoked drunken driving driving offenses problem occurs digital world grantor certificate may decide revoke person organization holding abused way also revoked subject private key exposed worse yet ca private key compromised thus pki needs deal issue revocation possibility revocation complicates matters sec 8 5 management public keys first step direction ca periodically issue crl certificate revocation list giving serial numbers certificates revoked since certificates contain expiry times crl need contain serial numbers certificates yet expired expiry time passed certificate automatically invalid distinction needed timed actually revoked cases used unfortunately introducing crls means user use certificate must acquire crl see certificate revoked used however even certificate list might revoked list published thus way really sure ask ca next use certificate ca asked since certificate might revoked seconds ago another complication revoked certificate could conceivably reinstated example revoked nonpayment fee since paid deal revocation possibly reinstatement eliminates one best properties certificates namely used without contact ca crls stored good place would place certificates stored one strategy ca actively push crls periodically directories process simply removing revoked certificates directories used storing certificates crls cached various places around network since crl signed document tampered tampering easily detected certificates long lifetimes crls long example credit cards valid 5 years number revocations outstanding much longer new cards issued every 3

communication partner supposed imposter verifying identity remote process face malicious active intruder surprisingly difficult requires complex protocols based cryptography section study many authentication protocols used insecure computer networks aside people confuse authorization authentication authentication deals question whether actually communicating specific process authorization concerned process permitted example say client process contacts file server says scott process want delete file cookbook old file server point view two questions must answered 828 network security 1 actually scott process authentication 2 scott allowed delete cookbook old authorization questions unambiguously answered affirmative requested action take place former question really key one file server knows talking checking authorization matter looking entries local tables databases reason concentrate authentication section general model essentially authentication protocols use alice starts sending message either bob trusted kdc key distribution center expected honest several message exchanges follow various directions messages sent trudy may intercept modify replay order trick alice bob gum works nevertheless protocol completed alice sure talking bob bob sure talking alice furthermore protocols two also established secret session key use upcoming conversation practice performance reasons data traffic encrypted using symmetric key cryptography typically aes triple des although public key cryptography widely used authentication protocols establishing session key point using new randomly chosen session key new connection minimize amount traffic gets sent users secret keys public keys reduce amount ciphertext intruder obtain minimize damage done process crashes core dump falls wrong hands hopefully key present session key permanent keys carefully zeroed session established 8 7 1 authentication based shared secret key first authentication protocol assume alice bob already share secret key kab shared key might agreed upon telephone person event insecure network protocol based principle found many authentication protocols one party sends random number transforms special way returns result protocols called challenge response protocols subsequent authentication protocols following notation used b identities alice bob ri challenges identifies challenger ki keys indicates owner ks session key sec 8 7 authentication protocols message sequence first shared key authentication protocol illustrated message 1 alice sends identity bob way bob understands bob course way knowing whether message came alice trudy chooses challenge large random number rb sends back alice message 2 plaintext alice encrypts message key shares bob sends ciphertext kab rb back message 3 bob sees message immediately knows came alice trudy know kab thus could generated furthermore since rb chosen randomly large space say 128 bit random numbers unlikely trudy would seen rb response earlier session equally unlikely could guess correct response challenge alice 3 rb kab rb bob ra kab ra two way authentication using challenge response protocol point bob sure talking alice alice sure anything alice knows trudy might intercepted message 1 sent back rb response maybe bob died last night find talking alice picks random number ra sends bob plaintext message 4 bob responds kab ra alice knows talking bob wish establish session key alice pick one ks send bob encrypted kab protocol contains five messages let us see clever eliminate one approach illustrated alice initiates challenge response protocol instead waiting bob similarly responding alice challenge bob sends entire protocol reduced three messages instead five new protocol improvement original one one sense shorter unfortunately also wrong certain circumstances trudy defeat protocol using known reflection attack particular trudy break possible open multiple sessions bob situation would true example bob bank prepared accept many simultaneous connections teller machines 830 network security ra bob alice rb kab ra kab rb shortened two way authentication protocol trudy reflection attack shown starts trudy claiming alice sending rt bob responds usual challenge rb trudy stuck know kab rb first session rb kab rt rt rb bob trudy second session rb2 kab rb kab rb first session reflection attack open second session message 3 supplying rb taken message 2 challenge bob calmly encrypts sends back kab rb message 4 shaded messages second session make stand trudy missing information complete first session abort second one bob convinced trudy alice asks bank account balance gives without question asks transfer secret bank account switzerland without moment hesitation moral story designing correct authentication protocol much harder looks following four general rules often help designer avoid common pitfalls sec 8 7 authentication protocols 1 initiator prove responder avoids bob giving away valuable information trudy give evidence 2 initiator responder use different keys proof even means two shared keys kab k ab 3 initiator responder draw challenges different sets example initiator must use even numbers responder must use odd numbers 4 make protocol resistant attacks involving second parallel session information obtained one session used different one even one rules violated protocol frequently broken four rules violated disastrous consequences let us go take closer look surely protocol subject reflection attack maybe quite subtle trudy able defeat protocol using reflection attack possible open second session bob trick answering questions would happen alice general purpose computer also accepted multiple sessions rather person computer let us take look trudy see trudy attack works see alice starts announcing identity message 1 trudy intercepts message begins session message 2 claiming bob shaded session 2 messages alice responds message 2 saying message 3 claim bob prove point trudy stuck prove bob trudy goes back first session turn send challenge sends ra got message 3 alice kindly responds message 5 thus supplying trudy information needs send message 6 session 2 point trudy basically home free successfully responded alice challenge session 2 cancel session 1 send old number rest session 2 authenticated session alice session 2 trudy nasty really wants rub instead sending old number complete session 2 waits alice sends message 7 alice challenge session 1 course trudy know respond uses reflection attack sending back ra 2 message 8 alice conveniently encrypts ra 2 message 9 trudy switches back session 1 sends alice number wants message 10 conveniently copied alice sent message 9 point trudy two fully authenticated sessions alice attack somewhat

rules discussed earlier attack could stopped detailed discussion kinds attacks thwart see bird et al 1993 also show possible systematically construct protocols provably correct simplest protocol nevertheless bit complicated show different class protocol also works new authentication protocol shown bird et al 1993 uses hmac type saw studying ipsec alice starts sending bob nonce ra message 1 bob responds selecting nonce rb sending back along hmac hmac formed building data structure consisting alice nonce bob nonce identities shared secret key kab data structure hashed hmac example using sha 1 alice receives message 2 ra picked rb arrives plaintext two identities secret key kab known along compute hmac agrees hmac message knows talking bob trudy know kab thus figure hmac send alice responds bob hmac containing two nonces trudy somehow subvert protocol force either party encrypt hash value choice happened hmacs include values chosen sending party something trudy control 833 authentication protocols alice ra rb hmac ra rb b kab bob hmac ra rb kab authentication using hmacs using hmacs way use idea alternative scheme often used instead computing hmac series items encrypt items sequentially using cipher block chaining 8 7 2 establishing shared key diffie hellman key exchange far assumed alice bob share secret key suppose far universally accepted pki signing distributing certificates establish one one way would alice call bob give key phone would probably start saying know alice trudy could try arrange meeting one bringing passport driver license three major credit cards busy people might able find mutually acceptable date months fortunately incredible may sound way total strangers establish shared secret key broad daylight even trudy carefully recording every message protocol allows strangers establish shared secret key called diffie hellman key exchange diffie hellman 1976 works follows alice bob agree two large numbers n g n prime n 1 2 also prime certain conditions apply g numbers may public either one pick n g tell openly alice picks large say 1024 bit number x keeps secret similarly bob picks large secret number alice initiates key exchange protocol sending bob message containing n g g x mod n shown bob responds sending alice message containing g mod n alice raises number bob sent xth power modulo n get g mod n x mod n bob performs similar operation get g x mod n mod n laws modular arithmetic calculations yield g xy mod n lo behold magic alice bob suddenly share secret key g xy mod n 834 network security alice picks x bob picks n g gx mod n gy mod n alice computes gy mod n x mod n gxy mod n bob alice bob computes gx mod n mod n gxy mod n diffie hellman key exchange trudy course seen messages knows g n message 1 could compute x could figure secret key trouble given g x mod n find x practical algorithm computing discrete logarithms modulo large prime number known make example concrete use completely unrealistic values n 47 g 3 alice picks x 8 bob picks 10 kept secret alice message bob 47 3 28 38 mod 47 28 bob message alice 17 alice computes 178 mod 47 4 bob computes 2810 mod 47 4 alice bob independently determined secret key 4 find key trudy solve equation 3x mod 47 28 done exhaustive search small numbers like numbers hundreds bits long currently known algorithms simply take far long even massively parallel lightning fast supercomputers despite elegance diffie hellman algorithm problem bob gets triple 47 3 28 know alice trudy way know unfortunately trudy exploit fact deceive alice bob illustrated alice bob choosing x respectively trudy picks random number z alice sends message 1 intended bob trudy intercepts sends message 2 bob using correct g n public anyway z instead x also sends message 3 back alice later bob sends message 4 alice trudy intercepts keeps everybody modular arithmetic alice computes secret key g xz mod n trudy messages alice bob computes g yz mod n trudy messages bob alice thinks talking bob establishes session key trudy bob every message alice sends encrypted session captured trudy stored modified desired optionally passed bob similarly direction trudy sees everything modify messages alice bob illusion secure channel one another sec 8 7 authentication protocols alice picks x trudy picks z n g gx mod n gz mod n n g gz mod n bob trudy alice bob picks gy mod n man middle attack reason attack known man middle attack also called bucket brigade attack vaguely resembles old time volunteer fire department passing buckets along line fire truck fire 8 7 3 authentication using key distribution center ka b ks kb ks bob alice kdc setting shared secret stranger almost worked quite hand probably worth first place sour grapes attack talk n people way would need n keys popular people key management would become real burden especially key stored separate plastic chip card different approach introduce trusted key distribution center model user single key shared kdc authentication session key management go kdc simplest known kdc authentication protocol involving two parties trusted kdc depicted first attempt authentication protocol using kdc idea behind protocol simple alice picks session key ks tells kdc wants talk bob using ks message encrypted 836 network security secret key alice shares kdc ka kdc decrypts message extracting bob identity session key constructs new message containing alice identity session key sends message bob encryption done kb secret key bob shares kdc bob decrypts message learns alice wants talk key wants use authentication happens free kdc knows message 1 must come alice since one else would able encrypt alice secret key similarly bob knows message 2 must come kdc trusts since one else knows secret key unfortunately protocol serious flaw trudy needs money figures legitimate service perform alice makes attractive offer gets job work trudy politely requests alice pay bank transfer alice establishes session key banker bob sends bob message requesting money transferred trudy account meanwhile trudy back old ways snooping network copies message 2 money transfer request follows later replays bob thinks alice must hired trudy clearly good work bob transfers equal amount money alice account trudy time 50th message pair bob runs office find trudy offer big loan expand obviously successful business problem called replay attack several solutions replay attack possible first one include timestamp message anyone receives obsolete message discarded trouble approach clocks never exactly synchronized network interval timestamp valid trudy replay message interval get away second solution put nonce message party remember previous nonces reject message containing previously used nonce nonces remembered forever lest trudy try replaying 5 year old message also machine crashes loses nonce list vulnerable replay attack timestamps nonces combined limit long nonces remembered clearly protocol going get lot complicated sophisticated approach mutual authentication use multiway challenge response protocol well known example protocol needham schroeder authentication protocol needham schroeder 1978 one variant shown protocol begins alice telling kdc wants talk bob message contains large random number ra nonce kdc sends back message 2 containing alice random number session key ticket authentication protocols ka ra b ks kb ks kb ks ks ra2 bob alice ra b kdc ks ra2 1 rb ks rb 1 needham schroeder authentication protocol send bob point random number ra assure alice message 2 fresh replay bob identity also enclosed case trudy gets funny ideas replacing b message 1 identity kdc encrypt ticket end message 2 kt instead kb ticket encrypted kb included inside encrypted message prevent trudy replacing something else way back alice alice sends ticket bob along new random number ra 2 encrypted session key ks message 4 bob sends back ks ra 2 1 prove alice talking real bob sending back ks ra 2 would worked since trudy could stolen message 3 receiving message 4 alice convinced talking bob replays could used far generated ra 2 milliseconds ago purpose message 5 convince bob indeed alice talking replays used either party generate challenge respond one possibility kind replay attack eliminated although protocol seems pretty solid slight weakness trudy ever manages obtain old session key plaintext initiate new session bob replaying message 3 corresponds compromised key convince alice denning sacco 1981 time plunder alice bank account without perform legitimate service even needham schroeder 1987 later published protocol corrects problem issue journal otway rees 1987 also published protocol solves problem shorter way shows slightly modified otway rees protocol otway rees protocol alice starts generating pair random numbers r used common identifier ra alice use challenge bob bob gets message constructs new message encrypted part alice message analogous one network security b r ka b r ra kdc alice ka ra ks ka b r ra b kb b r rb bob kb rb ks otway rees authentication protocol slightly simplified parts encrypted ka kb identify alice bob contain common identifier contain challenge kdc checks see r parts might trudy tampered r message 1 replaced part message 2 two rs match kdc believes request message bob valid generates session key encrypts twice alice bob message contains receiver random number proof kdc trudy generated message point alice bob possession session key start communicating first time exchange data messages one see one identical copy ks authentication complete 8 7 4 authentication using kerberos authentication protocol used many real systems including windows 2000 later versions kerberos based variant needhamschroeder named multiheaded dog greek mythology used guard entrance hades presumably keep undesirables kerberos designed allow workstation users access network resources secure way biggest difference needham schroeder assumption clocks fairly well synchronized protocol gone several iterations v5 one widely used industry defined rfc 4120 earlier version v4 finally retired serious flaws found yu et al 2004 v5 improves v4 many small changes protocol improved features fact longer relies dated des information see neuman ts 1994 kerberos involves three servers addition alice client workstation 1 authentication server verifies users login 2 ticket granting server tgs issues proof identity tickets 3 bob server actually work alice wants performed sec 8 7 authentication protocols

would ask tgs ticket accepted tgs distant realm distant tgs registered local tgs way local servers local tgs give alice ticket valid distant tgs business getting tickets servers realm note however parties two realms business one must trust tgs otherwise business 8 7 5 authentication using public key cryptography mutual authentication also done using public key cryptography start alice needs get bob public key pki exists directory server hands certificates public keys alice ask bob shown message 1 reply message 2 x 509 certificate containing bob public key alice verifies signature correct

implementations call user agent final step actually send message see pgp works let us consider example alice wants send signed plaintext message p bob secure way alice bob private dx public ex rsa keys let us assume one knows public key cover pgp key management shortly alice starts invoking pgp program computer pgp first hashes message p using md5 encrypts resulting hash using private rsa key da bob eventually gets message decrypt hash alice public key verify hash correct even someone else e g trudy could acquire hash stage decrypt alice known public key strength md5 guarantees would computationally infeasible produce another message md5 hash encrypted hash original message concatenated single message p1 compressed using zip program uses zivlempel algorithm ziv lempel 1977 call

computation knows p correct message came alice worth noting rsa used two places encrypt 128 bit md5 hash encrypt 128 bit idea key although rsa slow encrypt 256 bits large volume data furthermore 256 plaintext bits exceedingly random considerable amount work required trudy part determine guessed key correct heavyduty encryption done idea orders magnitude faster rsa thus pgp provides security compression digital signature much efficient way scheme illustrated pgp supports four rsa key lengths user select one appropriate lengths 1 casual 384 bits broken easily today 2 commercial 512 bits breakable three letter organizations 3 military 1024 bits breakable anyone earth 4 alien 2048 bits breakable anyone planets either sec 8 8 email security since rsa used two small computations everyone use alienstrength keys time format classic pgp message shown numerous formats also use message three parts containing idea key signature message respectively key part contains key also key identifier

alice outgoing traffic forge incoming traffic practice tap either alice phone line bob since tapping fiber backbone fairly difficult active wiretapping certainly possible fair amount work trudy clever

fool dns turns relatively easy briefly summarized trudy trick dns server alice isp sending query look bob address unfortunately since dns uses udp dns server real way checking supplied answer trudy exploit property forging expected reply thus injecting false ip address dns server cache simplicity assume alice isp initially entry bob web site bob com trudy wait times try later use tricks sec 8 9
